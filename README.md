If you want to check our website, you must put all of the 3 files in a folder then you gotta open that folder in your VS Code, and then you have to save those files first. Now you can use the website.
If you've a Go Live extension on your VS Code, then you can directly open it.

├── script.js\
├── README.md

### Explanation of the structure:
- **index.html**: The main HTML file for our web application.
- **script.css**: The main CSS files for styling our web pages.
- **script.js**: The main JavaScript file where we write our application logic.
- **README.md**: A documentation file that explains the project, its structure, and how to run it or work on it.

The choice of structure and tools also depends on the specific requirements and technologies you're using, so feel free to adapt and extend this structure to meet your project's needs.
